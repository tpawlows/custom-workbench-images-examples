# Custom Workbench Images for Red Hat OpenShift AI

This repository was created by the CAI team.
This repository provides a fast way to add a collection of community-contributed Custom Workbench Images for Red Hat OpenShift AI (RHOAI), helping you get to work faster with specialized tools and libraries.

These images extend the functionality of your RHOAI environment with additional tools and capabilities that can be immediately accessed by all users.

They are not part of the core product, and therefore, do not fall under the support umbrella of OpenShift AI.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to install and use the custom workbench images in your Red Hat OpenShift AI environment. For detailed installation instructions, see the documentation in the [`imagestreams`](./imagestreams) directory.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- Red Hat OpenShift cluster with administrator access
- Red Hat OpenShift AI (RHOAI) installed and configured
- `oc` CLI tool installed and logged in with cluster-admin privileges

### Installation

You can install all images at once or individually from the [`imagestreams`](./imagestreams) directory based on your needs.

#### Install All Images

To install all available custom workbench images, run the following command:

```bash
# Apply all custom workbench images
oc apply -k https://github.com/rh-ai-kickstart/custom-workbench-images-examples/imagestreams/
```

#### Install Individual Images

To install a specific image, use the appropriate command below:

```bash
# Set the base URL for individual image streams
URL='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rh-ai-kickstart/custom-workbench-images-examples/main/imagestreams'

# Install AnythingLLM
oc apply -f ${URL}/AnythingLLM-Custom-Workbench-Image.yaml

# Install ODH-TEC
oc apply -f ${URL}/ODH-TEC-Custom-Workbench-Image.yaml

# Install Gaudi-PyTorch
oc apply -f ${URL}/Gaudi-PyTorch-Workbench-Image.yaml

# Install Gaudi-DataScience
oc apply -f ${URL}/Gaudi-DataScience-Workbench-Image.yaml
```

## Usage

After installation, the new images will be available in the RHOAI dashboard. Users can select them when creating or configuring workbenches, just as they would with the default images.
